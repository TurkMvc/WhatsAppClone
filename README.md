# WhatsAppClone
This is a meteor project. This project basically what i tried to learn meteor js. 
this app what i had done is to created a whatsapp clone chat application which basically the same UI of the whatsapp.
WHat i had use for this app is the meteor . meteor is the javascript platform which uses the new ecma script(ECMA 2015) and
basically a platform over the node js . For front end i used blaze which is a javascript front end template . 
I used mongo db as data base as it is the easy for data binding.
